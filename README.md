# 🧮 Advanced Calculator Project

## 📌 Overview
This calculator goes beyond basic arithmetic, offering advanced mathematical operations to enhance usability. From fundamental calculations to complex equations, this tool is built to support diverse problem-solving needs.

## 🚀 Features

### ✖️➖➕➗ **Basic Calculation**
Perform fundamental arithmetic operations:
- **Addition** (`+`) ➡️ Combine two numbers for a total.
- **Subtraction** (`-`) ➡️ Find the difference between two numbers.
- **Multiplication** (`*`) ➡️ Scale one number by another.
- **Division** (`/`) ➡️ Split a number into equal parts.

### 🔢 **Calculate the Power of a Number**
Compute the power of any given number:
- **Formula:** `base^exponent`
- **Example:** `2^3 = 8`
- Ideal for exponential calculations in various mathematical contexts.

### 🏆 **Solve Equations with Variables**
Solve algebraic equations involving variables:
- **Linear Equations** 🧩 `ax + b = c` ➡️ Find the value of `x`.
- **Quadratic Equations** 🏗️ `ax^2 + bx + c = 0` ➡️ Solve using the quadratic formula.

### 📏 **Find Square Root**
Quickly compute the square root of a given number:
- **Formula:** `√x`
- **Example:** `√25 = 5`

### 🔀 **Calculate Percentage**
Determine percentages for financial and statistical calculations:
- **Formula:** `(value / total) * 100`
- **Example:** `50 out of 200 = 25%`

### 🔣 **Factorial Calculation**
Find the factorial of a number (useful for probability and combinatorics):
- **Formula:** `n! = n × (n-1) × ... × 1`
- **Example:** `5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120`

### 📊 **Logarithm Calculation**
Compute logarithmic values for scientific and mathematical functions:
- **Formula:** `log_b(x) = y` ➡️ `b^y = x`
- **Example:** `log_10(1000) = 3`

### 🎲 **Random Number Generator**
Generate random numbers for gaming, statistics, and simulations:
- **Usage:** Set a range (min & max) and get a random value.
- **Example:** Random number between 1 and 100.

### 📅 **Date & Time Calculator**
Perform operations on dates and times:
- Add/subtract days from a date.
- Calculate time differences between events.
